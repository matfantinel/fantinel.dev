# Forking/Public Template

If you wanna use this site as a base for building your own, I highly recommend basing it off [my public SvelteKit blog template](https://github.com/matfantinel/sveltekit-static-blog-template) instead! It is better documented and there is way less stuff to remove.

# fantinel.dev

This is my own personal website, built with SvelteKit. It also holds my own personal blog.

</p>

It was built with a few goals in mind:

- Responsive design: the website looks and behaves well on screens of all sizes;
- Fast: it only loads what's needed for it to work;
- Adaptive: it supports dark mode from most operating systems by default (desktop and mobile);
- Privacy-friendly: I don't need to know who you are and what you do. It uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) instead of Google Analytics;
- Pretty: have a pleasant design that is both accessible and pleasing to the eye.

I achieved this with the help of SvelteKit. There is almost no JavaScript running, and it actually works with JS disabled! While JS is awesome, it's important to know when it's not needed.

# Building & Running Locally

To run it locally, you simply have to run:

```shell
# First, install dependencies
npm install
# Then, run it on dev mode
npm run dev
```

The site should now be available at http://localhost:5173/ on your local machine, and your local machine's IP address on your networkâ€”great for testing on mobile OSes.

# Histoire / Storybook

I've used [Histoire](https://histoire.dev), a Vite-based Storybook alternative to be able to see and develop components in isolation. To open it, run `npm run story:dev`.

# Image Optimization

This website uses [image-transmutation](https://github.com/matfantinel/image-transmutation) to automatically optimize images used in the site. This means that even if you use non-optimal image formats (like lossless PNGs), it will go over the images and convert images to WebP and AVIF for you, as long as you use the `<Image />` component instead of `<img />`. This is done on build, so it doesn't change anything when running the website locally.

# Managing Posts

All posts are Markdown files that are processed with [svelte-markdown](https://github.com/pablo-abc/svelte-markdown) so that the renderers can be customized. In order to make it easier to manage posts, I highly recommend the [Front Matter VS Code extension](https://frontmatter.codes/), which gives you a nice CMS-like UI.

# Hosting

This site is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and uses SvelteKit's `adapter-auto` on build. It can also be generated as a static site, and hosted pretty much anywhere. To do that, simply replace `adapter-auto` with `adapter-static` on `svelte.config.js` and `package.json` (and re-run `npm install`).

# Markdown Syntax

I've recently updated the Markdown syntax to match [Obsidian's](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax). With a few added goodies.

| Effect | Syntax | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Bold | ** or __ | \*\*example\*\* |
| Italic | * or _ | \*example\* |
| Strikethrough | ~~ | \~\~example\~\~ |
| Highlight | == | \=\=example\=\= |
| Links | \[\]\(\) | \[text\]\(url\) |
| Blockquotes | \> | \> Quote |
| Sparkling Highlight | @@ | \@\@example\@\@ |
| Button | \[text\](url 'button prop=value') | \[Example\](url 'button color=secondary href=url') |
| Callout | > \[!type\] | > \[!info\]<br>> Example |
| Image | !\[Alt text \|\| custom-class\](url 'figcaption') | !\[Example image \|\| full-bleed\](/test.jpg 'A sample image'\]
