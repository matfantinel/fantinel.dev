I've recently re-launched my personal website and blog, that's now reached its 3rd version. There was nothing wrong with the previous one, but I wanted to both give it a small visual refresh and learn something new. So, after a month or so of working on it on my free time, <SparklingHighlight color="secondary">voilà</SparklingHighlight>, you're seeing it right now!

<Callout type="warning">
	SvelteKit has recently launched its first stable version (1.0), but this article was written while it was still in Beta. I'm pretty sure all that's covered in this article still works, but keep in mind a few details might work differently if you're using SvelteKit 1.0.

    I'll do my best to update this article as soon as possible. If you find anything in here that's not working anymore, feel free to [let me know!](https://github.com/matfantinel/matfantinel.github.io/issues)

## About Svelte and SvelteKit

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a new cool kid on the JS block - it was launched in 2016, but it really started getting traction when its 3.0 version was launched in 2019. It is a competitor to the big JS frameworks - React, Vue, Angular - but, instead of simply being an alternative way of doing things, it differentiates itself on a fundamental level: <MarkerHighlight>it is a compiler, not a framework.</MarkerHighlight>

This means that it does its job at build time, not at runtime. While other frameworks (React, for example) need JavaScript code that runs on the client in order for your components to work properly, Svelte does not, because it interprets your code on build time, and only ships exactly what it needs to run. This means websites made with Svelte can be much smaller in size and faster because it has less code to run.

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is a framework built on top of that. It is an opinionated set of rules that helps you get a Svelte app built pretty quickly. You can compare it to NextJS (for React) or Nuxt (for Vue). It has great defaults and encourages good practices, like server-side rendering, for example. At the time of building this website, SvelteKit was still in Beta. However, progress is steady and its API seems to be already stable, so it's unlikely there will be any breaking changes before 1.0 arrives.

Using both of the above allowed my website to have two important characteristics:

- Every single page is rendered at build time (server-side rendering). This means that as long as the HTML and CSS files are downloaded, it will look as it was meant to be;
- JavaScript is not needed. Try disabling JavaScript on your browser. You'll still be able to read this blog post and everything will look the same.

## Progressive Enhancement

One of the concepts that really caught my eye with Svelte is the idea of Progressive Enhancement: <MarkerHighlight>making sure your app runs for everyone, and making it progressively more featureful if the user's device supports it</MarkerHighlight>. My website is a pretty simple project, but still there are instances of this:

If there's no JavaScript, the website uses the browser's native navigation API. Which means you can navigate between pages normally without any client-side code. _However_, if JavaScript is available, a client-side router will be used to make the transition between pages smoother and faster. This means that even if the user's device doesn't support JS for any reason<span class="text-info">\*</span>, the site will still be completely functional.

<Callout type="info">
  We tend to think of JavaScript being disabled as a user choice, but that is not always the case. Think of someone using their phone on a weak 3G connection that fails to load the .js files, or someone in a metro that lost signal while loading the page. It happens often and being able to show your content even in these conditions is a great way of not losing a visitor.
</Callout>

And you know what I had to do to support this? _Nothing_. Just using `<a>` elements is enough, as SvelteKit will intercept those if needed (JS enabled), or simply leave it to the browser otherwise.

## Design

I'm not a designer, but I like to pretend I am. So, instead of designing-as-I-go when developing the website, I decided to fully design it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) before starting development. I figured that using it to design stuff is the best way to learn the platform, and I really finished this design much better at Figma than I was before. Auto-layout is fantastic since it works so much like CSS Flexbox, so I was able to approach it with a similar thought-process as I have when developing stuff.

The design itself was something I came up with, and it's an amalgamation of ideas and inspirations that were stored in my head. When building it, I wasn't entirely sure where the inspiration came from, but now it is apparent to me that most of it comes from some websites I love: [Josh Comeau's](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) and [George Francis'](https://georgefrancis.dev/).

After the design was complete, I finally began developing it. Since there are some things that you can only find out while developing it and giving it more attention, I made some small tweaks to the design while implementing it. Still, the final result was _really_ similar to the initial design. I count that as a success!

## Routing

<Callout type="info">

    Initially, SvelteKit used a _file_-based routing, as opposed to the current _folder_-based routing. This article has been updated to reflect those changes. If you were familiar with the previous system, [this comment by the SvelteKit team](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/5774#discussioncomment-3294867) might help you understand the changes.

</Callout>

SvelteKit uses a folder-based routing system. This means that your routes are dictated by the folder structure inside `routes` in your project. Every route **must** have a folder, except for the root ('/').

Inside each folder, you can add files that build up your page. Typically, in other frameworks, you would have a `index.{html/js/jsx}` file where everything the page needed would be loaded from. In SvelteKit, you can have multiple files, each representing a different part of the page.

The only required file is `+page.svelte`. This is where you can add your markup, components, styles and logic. However, it's likely that your page might need to load some data to be displayed. This can be done on another file, `+page.js`, in the same folder. There, you can add a `load` function where you'll have access to query params and other things and be able to load all the data your page needs.

The cool thing about that is that SvelteKit will use the content of the `+page.js` file **both server-side and client-side**, depending on the situation. However, if the data you need can only be loaded on the server (like for example querying a database or using a secret key), you can name it `+page.server.js` instead. Both would do the same thing, however <MarkerHighlight> the naming difference makes it much easier on a quick glance to identify what runs where.</MarkerHighlight>

So, an example of what the basic file structure for my website would look like:

<CodeBlock>

```bash
└── routes
	├── +layout.svelte
	├── +page.svelte # / (root page)
	├── resume
		└── +page.svelte # /resume
	├── blog
		├── +page.svelte # /blog
		└── +page.js # Loads data to show on /blog
	├── [slug]
		├── +page.svelte # Dynamic route (blog posts)
		└── +page.js # Loads data for blog post
```

</CodeBlock>

Having multiple files in a folder might look a bit cumbersome at first, but it makes their purpose **much** clearer. The great reasoning behind this pattern is that it gives you a single way of doing routing instead of multiple, which makes things more standardized and easier to understand later on. Remember, SvelteKit is opinionated on purpose, and I think folder-based routing is more readable and I'd say more flexible than other file-based routing solutions, although it is a bit more verbose.

The `+layout.svelte` file is a base layout for all the pages inside the route. Which means that I can have shared code for all pages in there. See the example below, where I added the header and footer components to the layout, and load the content of the route itself in the `<slot>` element:

<CodeBlock lang="svelte" filename="+layout.svelte">

```svelte
<Header />

<main>
	<slot />
</main>

<Footer />
```

</CodeBlock>

### Blog Post Page / Dynamic Routing

But what about the blog post page? Well, that one is a special case. If you look at the URL loaded right now, you'll see that it is specific to this blog post. However, that doesn't mean there is one folder for each blog post on the routes directory.

You see, every blog post page is the same one, however its content is loaded based on the URL it receives. To achieve this, I used SvelteKit's dynamic routing with a folder called `[slug]`. The brackets indicate that the route might be dynamic, and whatever URL comes in, it will be caught by this folder (unless it's caught by explicit routes like /blog shown above). Not only that, but that part of the URL will be accessible in the page as a parameter (called, in this case, _slug_). This parameter allows the page to know which blog post to display.

However, there's still an extra step I wanted to take. Blog posts only have their own content, but I wanted to add a few extra things on the page that weren't present in the main `+layout.svelte` file, like the post title and related posts at the bottom. For that, I used a **[layout group](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/advanced-routing#advanced-layouts-group)**, defining that the post page shouldn't use the main layout, but instead have its own.

To create a layout group, I've created a folder inside of `routes` with the name of the new layout `blog-article`, wrapped in parentheses to indicate it uses its own layout. The routes directory ended up like this:

<CodeBlock>

```bash
└── routes
	├── +layout.svelte
	├── +page.svelte # / (root page)
	├── resume
		└── +page.svelte # /resume
	├── blog
		├── +page.svelte # /blog
		└── +page.js # Loads data to show on /blog
	├── (blog-article)
		├── +layout.svelte # This layout applies only to this folder
		├── [slug]
			├── +page.svelte # Dynamic route (blog posts)
			└── +page.js # Loads data for blog post
```

</CodeBlock>

Keep in mind that, just like pages, layout files can also have their data-loading counterparts: `+layout.js` and `+layout.server.js`.

## The blog

The main challenge for me was in processing Markdown(.md) files of the blog posts into actual Svelte code. Unlike Jekyll, which I was using previously for this blog, SvelteKit doesn't have anything built-in for this (yet) and online resources are a bit scarce (which is normal, since it's still in beta).

I had three requisites for this:

- I wanted to write blog posts in Markdown, because of its ease, and also so I wouldn't have to rewrite all the existing posts;
- I wanted to be able to use Svelte components inside the blog posts as well, for more interactive elements;
- It has to be rendered on build time so the blog can be deployed to GitHub Pages;

I had heard about something similar to what I wanted, called MDX. It allows everything I wanted, however, it was React-based and I couldn't use it. Luckily, I found out about [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.com/), a project with the same goal as MDX, but for Svelte!

After setting it up, I had to figure out how to actually use it. I found some examples on the internet, which seemed very straightforward. Most of them created a `/posts` folder inside the routes, and then put the .md files in there. MDsveX would do the work of transforming them into HTML pages on build, and that was it. However, that meant the post URL would have to become `https://fantinel.dev/posts/blog-post-name`. That isn't a huge problem by itself, but it was for me because it wouldn't be backwards-compatible with my previous blog URLs, that have been linked to a few times in other sites. I wanted to remove the need for "/posts" in the URL to keep that compatibility.

That means my page on `routes/[slug]/+page.svelte` should need some kind of logic that finds the correct blog post to show and dynamically loads the Svelte component generated by MDsveX. Not only that, but I needed to be able to extract the metadata of the post - its title, image, and date - to be able to display it on the `+layout.svelte` file, and also displaying the "Recent posts" cards on the home page.

### Extracting post data

I found out when searching that we can import all the .md files as modules, and process them via JS, since this code will run on the server. I ended up creating a `posts.js` file to centralize this logic, and did the following:

<CodeBlock lang="javascript" filename="posts.js">

```javascript
// Import the markdown files for each post
const imports = import.meta.globEager('./posts/*.md');

const posts = [];
for (const path in imports) {
	const post = imports[path];
	if (post) {
		// For each of them, MDsveX will do the heavy lifting. The "metadata"
		// is automatically recovered from the Frontmatter
		posts.push({
			...post.metadata
		});
	}
}

// Filter the post and order them by published date
const filteredPosts = posts
	.filter((post) => !post.hidden)
	.sort((a, b) =>
		new Date(a.date).getTime() > new Date(b.date).getTime()
			? -1
			: new Date(a.date).getTime() < new Date(b.date).getTime()
			? 1
			: 0
	);

// Expose this info to other files
export default filteredPosts;
```

</CodeBlock>

With that data being exported from that file, I can reuse it in the places I need:

#### Blog post page

On the `routes/[slug]/+page.svelte` file, I can now import the posts and look for the one I should display (by comparing slugs). After that, I'll get its module and use the special `<svelte:component>` ([see docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_component)) tag to use it inside the page.

<CodeBlock lang="javascript" filename="[slug]/+page.js">

```javascript
// Since it's on +page.js, this code will run before page load (likely on server)

// Get posts info
const allPosts = import.meta.glob('../../../lib/posts/*.md', { eager: true });

let posts = [];
// Get the posts' slugs
for (let path in allPosts) {
	const post = allPosts[path];
	const slug = post.metadata.slug;
	const p = { post, slug };
	posts.push(p);
}

export function load({ params }) {
	const { slug } = params;

	// Find the post with the slug
	const filteredPost = posts.find((p) => {
		return p.slug.toLowerCase() === slug.toLowerCase();
	});

	return {
		// Tell page to load that post's module
		page: filteredPost.post.default
	};
}
```

</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock lang="svelte" filename="[slug]/+page.svelte">

```svelte
<script>
	// Declare the page variable to use on the client
	export let page;
</script>

<!-- Here we'll load the component of the blog post page itself -->
<svelte:component this={page} />
```

</CodeBlock>

#### Listing all posts

Now the post page is done, we need a way to display all the posts on the main blog page. We already have them sorted and filtered in the `posts.js` file, so all I have to do is fetch that data and iterate on it to display them all.

Since the posts data comes from the server, it needs to run there. I'll use a `blog/+page.server.js` file to fetch that data and send it to the client-side page.

<CodeBlock lang="javascript" filename="blog/+page.server.js">

```javascript
import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import posts from '$lib/posts';

export async function load() {
	const result = Object.keys(posts).map((index) => {
		const { slug, title, date, excerpt, tags, readingTime } = posts[index];
		return {
			slug,
			title,
			date,
			excerpt,
			tags,
			readingTime
		};
	});

	if (result) {
		return {
			posts: result
		};
	}

	throw error(500, `Could not load blog posts`);
}
```

</CodeBlock>

And, on the page itself:

<CodeBlock lang="svelte" filename="blog/+page.svelte">

```svelte
<script>
	export let data;
	let { posts } = data;
</script>

{#each posts as post}
	<BlogPostCard {post} />
{/each}
```

</CodeBlock>

### RSS

Something that SvelteKit currently does not provide a solution for is a RSS feed. Previously, mine was built automatically by Jekyll and I never had to do anything to get it working. While this wasn't the case right now, I'm sure once SvelteKit is stable and mature, solutions for this will be available so no manual work has to be done.

I made mine by taking advantage of [SvelteKit's endpoints](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server) by creating a `+server.js` file, and serving a XML file that is generated at build time. I import the filtered posts from the `posts.js` file I created earlier, and use the metadata to build the content of the RSS file. You can check out [the source code](https://github.com/matfantinel/matfantinel.github.io/blob/main/src/routes/rss.xml/+server.js) for implementation details.

### Sitemap

Another thing that's still not built-in to SvelteKit is the sitemap. It's great for SEO, especially for newer websites, so I researched a good way of adding one. Luckily, someone already built a tool to generate them automatically, and there is already a discussion to build it into SvelteKit directly. Check out [svelte-sitemap](https://github.com/bartholomej/svelte-sitemap) for generating your own.

## Wrapping Up

My first experience with Svelte and SvelteKit was, overall, fantastic. It simplifies many parts of development and having server-side-rendering as a default option really drives forward their purpose of simplifying web both for users and developers.

Though I definitely did not use all of Svelte's strengths on this project, since it doesn't need dynamic data and an application state, I'll be working with that soon enough. Its ecosystem is not as big as its competitors', since Svelte is still small compared to them, but they're doing something right with their new approach, as Svelte is the most loved web framework according to [2021's StackOverflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks). Not to mention that Svelte itself doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, and therefore is compatible with almost everything JavaScript.

The small issues I've had while building this will definitely be gone soon, as they were caused by SvelteKit not being on a stable version yet. I'm excited to see how much the ecosystem grows the next year; I'll definitely be keeping an eye on it!

Don't forget all the code for this website and blog are open source, feel free to use it and to propose changes if you'd like!
