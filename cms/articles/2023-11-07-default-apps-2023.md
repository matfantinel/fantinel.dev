I saw this on [Matt Birchler's blog](https://birchtree.me/blog/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023/), and then saw the multitude of people posting about their default apps in their own blogs. I've never jumped on a trend like this before, so I figured this would be a fun first one to do 😅.

I guess you can say my choices are pretty vanilla; I've been through my phase of trying a specific app for everything, but nowadays I'm settling down on things that actually work.
