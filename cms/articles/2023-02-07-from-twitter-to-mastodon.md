Iâ€™m one of the many people that stopped using Twitter after the latestâ€¦ ðŸ’© *developments* since it was purchased by Elon Musk. My account still exists, but Iâ€™ve deleted all of my tweets and uninstalled the mobile app, and havenâ€™t opened the website in a good while.

Like many, Iâ€™ve moved to Mastodon, and so did \~90% of the people I used to follow. Initially it did feel a bit rough! This forced change required me to adapt and learn how the platform works. But Iâ€™m glad I did it!

Nowadays my Mastodon community is almost the same as my previous Twitter one, with a few added people, but it feels tighter. Itâ€™s hard to explain, but it seems like I feel much closer to them. I guess the lack of a recommendation algorithm (timeline is always in reverse chronological order) makes people actually see each othersâ€™ posts, and liking/replying/boosting(retweeting) is way more common.

Thereâ€™s one category of Twitter account that hasnâ€™t really moved to Mastodon yet: brands. I used to follow some brands on Twitter just to keep up to date on stuff, and brands like Notion and Arc do a great job with their accounts! But Iâ€™m not sure I wanna see that on Mastodon, at least not on that level. The best part of it is how itâ€™s built and used by *real people*, and not brands or influencers simply seeking engagement. You know, kinda like Twitter in its early days.

If you wanna follow me in there, feel free to do so! Iâ€™m on [hachyderm.io/fantinel](https://hachyderm.io/@fantinel) , or you can search me in there by [@fantinel@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@fantinel). Happy tooting!
