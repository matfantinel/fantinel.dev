> Likewise, I suspect most people on opposing sides of the Tailwind debate actually completely agree on Tailwind itself. I don’t think our divide centers on atomic CSS, or utility classes; I think the contention comes from valuations we made long before we ever chose our tools. Where one of us sees a selling point, the other sees a flaw.– Josh Collinsworth, in [Classic rock, Mario Kart, and why we can't agree on Tailwind](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/tailwind-is-smart-steering?utm_source=matt-fantinel)

I've found this gem of an article a while ago, and have been thinking constantly about it ever since. I think its idea of things being good and bad for the same reasons is spot on - and also the reason why we'll never agree on them.

I also dislike the idea of Tailwind, which made me never interested in using it. I prefer having total control of my styles and enjoy a clear separation between templates and styles. This, I guess, makes me a "crafter".
