This is a blog post created inside the **Obsidian** app. Let’s see ~~if~~ how it works!

@@@It works!@@@

But there are some things I need to look into to make the entire process smoother

1. Move this list to Notion, where I’ll actually see it ;)
2. Make sure blog posts work even if their filename doesn’t follow the pattern that the others do;
3. Create a template for a blog post in Obsidian, so I can create posts with the frontmatter already pre-filled;
4. Maybe move the cms folder (and assets?) to a git submodule. This would make content management simpler inside Obsidian, since I wouldn’t risk ruining the code files themselves;
