If you're seeing this, it means ==the Obsidian sync worked==! This post was created, written and published through **Obsidian**, using the *Git* plugin.

This one specifically was written on the laptop, but if this works, I want to set it up on the tablet as well.

> This is a blockquote. Does it work?

>[!info] And this is a callout. I think it's broken right now, but I want to change the syntax of callouts on the website.

I also need to check if there's a good way of adding images.



```javascript
~filename test.js
console.log('Hey ho!');
```
